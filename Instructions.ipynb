    "Regression works by establishing a relationship between variables in the data that represent characteristics—known as the features—of the thing being observed, and the variable we're trying to predict—known as the label. Recall our company that rents bicycles and wants to predict the expected number of rentals in a given day. In this case, features include things like the day of the week, month, and so on, while the label is the number of bicycle rentals.\n",
